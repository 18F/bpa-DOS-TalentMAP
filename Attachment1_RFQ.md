#### b. *Part One.* Part One of the offeror’s oral presentation will consist of the offeror answering the Government’s core questions related to the technical factors identified in the RFQ. While the technical factors are identified in the RFQ, the core questions are not. All offerors will be asked the same core questions related to the technical factors.

8**. Basis of Award and Evaluation Criteria**
---------------------------------------------

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules. The offerors agree to and are bound by all instructions, procedures and rules of this RFQ. The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value principles, utilizing the trade-off process. Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose quotation provides the greatest overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price.

1.  *Evaluation Process.* The Government intends to utilize a multi-phased approach for this procurement as described below. To be considered for award, offerors must successfully pass through each phase.

> **Phase 1 (Pass/Fail)**: Quote Compliance Check - A compliance check will be conducted to ensure that offerors submit a complete technical quotation and a price quotation following the instructions set on this RFQ letter. Only the offerors that receive *Pass* will advance to Phase 2.
>
> **Phase 2 (Adjectival):** Technical Compliance Check - Review of Written Technical Quotations to ensure that offerors meet technical requirements as outlined in the RFQ and the PWS. Only the four (4) highest rated offerors, with *Acceptable* rating or higher, will advance to Phase 3.
>
> **Phase 3 (Adjectival):** Oral Interview - Offerors that are considered in Phase 3 will be notified of the time and date of the oral interview. The oral interview will be focused on the offeror’s experience and skills with open source software development, human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods.
>
> **Phase 4:** Pricing Schedule and Pricing Narrative Check - Review of Price Quotations.

### b. *Technical Evaluation Factors.* The Government will evaluate Phase 2 and Phase 3 for an offeror’s performance or capability acceptability based on the following non-price technical factors which are of equal importance to each other:

-   **Technical Understanding and Approach:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s technical approach: level of knowledge, technical expertise, and overall understanding of the requirement. The Government will also evaluate the offeror’s skills with open source software development, human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods.

-   **Staffing Plan:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed staffing methodology and skill levels/labor categories as well as the availability and relevant work experience demonstrated by Key Personnel.

-   **Similar Experience:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s experience in performing projects of similar scope and complexity. The Government will also evaluate the offeror’s experience with open source software development, human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods.

###  c. *Price Evaluation Factors.* Each offeror’s price quotation will be evaluated separately from the technical quotation and oral interview. The Government will evaluate the offeror’s pricing schedule as well as pricing narrative after the Oral Interview to ensure that the offered price is fair, reasonable, and realistic. Pricing shall reflect reasonableness, consistency with industry standards, and be in compliance with rates and terms and conditions of the aBPA. Note that as submissions become more technically equal in their merit, the evaluated price becomes more important. Therefore, provide your best discounted rates.

d. *Scoring Plan*

The evaluation of Phase 1 above shall be accomplished using the Pass/Fail method.

The evaluation of Phase 2 and Phase 3 above shall be accomplished using the adjectival scoring method, for which definitions are provided below:

> **Outstanding: (O)** – Very significantly exceeds and/or addresses all of the elements of the evaluation factors. With respect to the evaluation factor, the response surpasses a “Exceeds” rating. The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality and cost effective performance is anticipated.
>
> **Exceeds: (E)** – Fully meets and/or addresses most elements of the evaluation factors. With respect to the evaluation factor, the response exceeds an “Acceptable” rating. The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency, performance and/or quality and cost effectiveness.
>
> **Acceptable: (A)** – Meets and/or addresses many elements of the evaluation factors. With respect to the evaluation factor, the response is considered comprehensive and exemplifies an understanding of the scope and depth of the requirements as well as the offeror’s understanding of the Government’s requirements.
>
> **Unacceptable: (U)** – With respect to the evaluation factor, the technical response has many deficiencies and/or omissions and does not adequately address the evaluation factor.
