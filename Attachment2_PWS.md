Department of State TalentMAP
=============================

**General Services Administration (GSA)/Technology Transformation Service (TTS)**

**and**

**Department of State (DOS)**

**Issued by:**

**General Services Administration (GSA)/National Capital Region (NCR)**

**Federal Acquisition Service (FAS)/Assisted Acquisition Services (AAS)**

**January 2017**

**NCR AAS Project Number ID11XXXXXX**

OBJECTIVES
----------

The DOS seeks the creation of a new system, TalentMAP, that will equitably and transparently manage and match Foreign Service employees to appropriate work assignments. The new system will maintain the existing business functionality and meet evolving requirements while leveraging best practices in software development. The DOS will be able to better carry out its diplomatic mission by: improving the matching process, reducing the amount of time it takes for Foreign Service employees to find good jobs, and improving the workflow for administrative staff to manage Foreign Service employees.

The target date for a beta version of a new TalentMAP application is the end of calendar year 2017. To help mitigate risk associated with such a long-term, yet aggressive timeline, the system will be built following agile development principles. Additionally, it will leverage open-source code, robust documentation, human-centered design, and an extensible infrastructure.

The initial phase of work will center on the management and display of information about Diplomatic Posts (for example, an Embassy in Paris) and Service Positions (for example, a Cultural Affairs Officer position at the Embassy.

BACKGROUND
----------

TalentMAP is anticipated to replace the Foreign Service Bidding (FSBid) application and serve as a unified source of information (currently stored outside of FSBID) regarding available Foreign Service positions and post data for Foreign Service employees. FSBid is the current system of record for internal bidding and assignment processes for Foreign Service employees. TalentMAP’s primary goal is to bring about a more secure, reliable and dedicated system to support the Bureau of Human Resources’ Career Development and Assignments Office (HR/CDA) business processes. HR/CDA supports the mission of the DOS by transparently and equitably assigning employees with the right skills to the right positions at the right time. The three Career Development Divisions of HR/CDA (EL, ML, and SL) are staffed by Career Development Officers (CDOs) who represent their clients in the assignments process. They provide counseling and advice on issues related to assignments from bidding to arrival at post, tenure, promotions, developmental training, tour of duty (including extensions and curtailments), skill code change, and leave without pay. HR/CDA also includes the Assignments Division (HR/CDA/AD), which supports the assignments process, the Professional Development Unit (HR/CDA/PDU), which manages details and long term training assignments, and the Office of Continuity Counseling (HR/CDA/CC), which supports mentoring and counseling programs, among other functions.

SCOPE
-----

The scope of this Call Order is for the Contractor to deliver the TalentMAP system.

Upon award, GSA TTS will publish the total price of the selected proposal and certain non-source-identifying data (for example, the number of bids, the mean price, median, and standard deviation of price). During the performance of this call order, GSA TTS will similarly publish source code, data related to project management (for example, user stories, milestones, and performance metrics), and top-line spending data.

### Data Rights and Ownership of Deliverables

Outside of research-related records (see § 7.7), the Government intends that any data or deliverable created as a result of the work performed under the call order be committed to the public domain. The default GSA TTS policy mirrors that of the 18F (TTS) Open Source policy found at the following link: <https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md>

Further, GSA TTS intends to commit the following items, to the public domain, at a minimum:

-   All data, documents, graphics and code created under this call order including but not limited to, plans, reports, schedules, schemas, metadata, architecture designs, and the like;

-   Any and all new open source software created by the Contractor and forks or branches of current open source software where the Contractor has made a modification; and,

-   Any and all new tooling, scripting configuration management, infrastructure as code, or any other final changes or edits to successfully deploy or operate the software.

The Contractor shall use open source technologies wherever possible, in support of the 18F (TTS) Source Code Policy. All licenses must be expressly listed in the deliverable. Regardless of license(s) used (e.g., MIT, GPL, Creative Commons 0) the license(s) shall be clearly listed in the documentation.

If the Contractor needs to use work that does not have an open source license, the Contractor is required to request permission from GSA TTS in writing, before using that work in any way in connection with the order. If approved, all licenses shall be clearly set forth in a conspicuous place when work is delivered to GSA TTS .

If an open source license provides implementation guidance, the Contractor shall ensure compliance with that guidance. If implementation guidance is not available, the Contractor shall attach or include the license within the work itself. Examples of this include code comments at the beginning of a file or contained in a license file within a software repository.

### Section 508 Compliance 

The Contractor shall support the Government in its conformance with Section 508 throughout the development and implementation of the work to be performed.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who do not have disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.

The following standard is applicable for compliance:
1194.22 Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications.

The Contractor should review the following websites for additional 508 information:

-   http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12

-   http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm

-   http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources
