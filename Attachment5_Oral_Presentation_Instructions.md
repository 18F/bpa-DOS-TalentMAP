### **
Rules**

The oral presentation consists of an initial question and answer session on technical factors, and a follow-up question and answer session (if necessary), associated with this RFQ does not and will not constitute discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR part 15. The Government is not obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, and solicit or allow revised quotes.

The entire oral presentation will be conducted remotely via video and audio. Offerors shall not bring or present slides, graphs, charts or any other written presentation materials nor will the Government accept or receive offeror handouts.

### **Oral Presentation**

#### **Part One**

Part One of the offeror’s oral presentation will consist of the offeror answering the Government’s core questions related to the technical factors identified in the Request For Quotation (RFQ). While the technical factors are identified in the RFQ, the core questions are not. All offerors will be asked the same core questions related to the technical factors. The questions are related to the offeror’s technical understanding and approach of the requirements identified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and quality control measures for overseeing performance. This part of the oral presentation of answers will not exceed 25 minutes, and may go shorter.

\*Note that each offeror will be provided the questions, via e-mail, approximately 60 minutes prior to their Oral Presentation.

#### **Part Two (only if necessary)**

The Government will allocate 15 minutes for follow-up questions following the offeror’s answers to the initial core questions on technical factors. During this time, the Government may ask questions on any information that had been presented by the offeror that the Government feels is unclear or needs elaboration. The Government’s questions may differ among the offerors based on what needs elaboration. If the Government has no follow-up questions with a particular offeror, then this part of the session will not take place. The answers given in this session are part of the offeror’s oral presentation.

Note: The Government is much more interested in the informational content of the offeror’s answers rather than the particular style or technique used in delivering the answers. The Government may take notes during the presentation at its discretion and exclusive right and property, and may use such notes in the evaluation. No copies will be provided to the offeror.

### **Location**

The oral presentation sessions will be conducted by video chat, though audio may be substituted as needed. The Government will coordinate and set up the meeting space accordingly (providing dial in or links using a tool such as Acano or Adobe Connect).

### **Date and Time**

The Government will schedule the date and time of the oral presentations with each offeror after the RFQ closing date and receipt of offeror quote submissions. The Government reserves the right to reschedule any offeror’s orals date at the discretion of the contracting officer.

### **Participants**

Offerors may include as many participants as it feels is necessary. Offerors are advised to have technical personnel present since the Government will ask technical questions during the oral presentations. Type and number of participants included is at the offeror’s discretion and is the full responsibility of the offeror. All proposed Key Personnel currently employed by the offeror or its teaming partners shall attend the session - the Government is most interested in hearing from staff that will have a direct role in performing on the task. The letter(s) of intent and resume(s) will suffice for Key Personnel currently not employed by the offeror or its teaming partners.

After the presentations, offerors shall provide an email to confirm attendance with names of participants to the meeting organizers.
