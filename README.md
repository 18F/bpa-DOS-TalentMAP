# Agile BPA Task Order for Department of State TalentMAP System

TalentMAP is anticipated to replace the Foreign Service Bidding (FSBid) application and serve as a unified source of information (currently stored outside of FSBID) regarding available Foreign Service positions and post data for Foreign Service employees. FSBid is the current system of record for internal bidding and assignment processes for Foreign Service employees. TalentMAP’s primary goal is to bring about a more secure, reliable and dedicated system to support the Bureau of Human Resources’ Career Development and Assignments Office (HR/CDA) business processes. HR/CDA supports the mission of the DOS by transparently and equitably assigning employees with the right skills to the right positions at the right time. The three Career Development Divisions of HR/CDA (EL, ML, and SL) are staffed by Career Development Officers (CDOs) who represent their clients in the assignments process. They provide counseling and advice on issues related to assignments from bidding to arrival at post, tenure, promotions, developmental training, tour of duty (including extensions and curtailments), skill code change, and leave without pay. HR/CDA also includes the Assignments Division (HR/CDA/AD), which supports the assignments process, the Professional Development Unit (HR/CDA/PDU), which manages details and long term training assignments, and the Office of Continuity Counseling (HR/CDA/CC), which supports mentoring and counseling programs, among other functions.
